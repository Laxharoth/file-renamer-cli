TODO: write filters 
[ ] filter is created from converting a String into the filter
[ ] filters should read many strings and determine if each contain some explicitly provided text fragments a wildcard character can be provided
[ ] filters can return a collection of the ordened fixed texts
[ ] filters can return a collection of the ordened text catched by the wild cards
[ ] alternatively the wildcard can be a counter
TODO: write renamer
[ ] Similar to filter renamer is created from convertig a String into the renamer
[ ] the renamer will take a collection of strings "A" (fixed text) and concatenate them adding other text from a different set of text "B" (wildcard catched text)
[ ] using the wildcard will insert from B using the same relative position (using it for the first time will pick the first wildcard catched text)
[ ] the renamer should be able to select from the "B" by position requires an 'opening' and 'closing' position selector.
[ ] renamer should not actually rename files just provide an array containing the original and modified name
TODO: write cli
[ ] Convert arguments into an options object that will feed filters functions, renamer functions
[ ] targetd directory: starting path of the tool
[ ] filter_string: the string with the wildcards
[ ] wildcard_char: the character used as wildcard
[ ] renamer_string: the template used to create the renamer
[ ] position_selector_wrapper: Opening and Closing characters for renamer position selectionr (requires 2 characters exactly)
[ ] dry_run: perform a dry run, not actually rename files but output the result.
